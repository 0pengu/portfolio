    description: (
      <>
        <p className="text-left">
          `@tahminator/pipeline` is a custom library I built that is used across
          all my personal repositories as well as all our repositories within
          Patina Network.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left">
          As a patented Gen-Z engineer, I always hated writing bash scripts; so
          I did what everyone my age does, make it so I can use TypeScript
          instead! :)
        </p>
        <p className="text-left">
          This library helps abstract a lot of logic into very easy to use
          clients. Some examples includes a Sonar client for code coverage in
          any language or configuration, local Postgres {"&"} Redis instances
          that can be spun up quickly
          {"&"} easily in CI, a GitHub client that can be used to interface with
          various parts of the Github API (including Actions functionality), and
          much more.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left">See some examples of it being used here:</p>
